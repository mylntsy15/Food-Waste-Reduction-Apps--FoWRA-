# FoWRA: Food Waste Reduction App

## Project Overview

FoWRA (Food Waste Reduction App) is a software project developed as part of the coursework for SSE3301 Software Requirement Engineering and SSE3302 Software Architecture and Design. This project is a group effort aimed at addressing the global issue of food waste, particularly prevalent in developed countries.

## Project Description

FoWRA is inspired by existing food waste reduction apps like OLIO and Kitche but incorporates additional features to enhance its utility and effectiveness. The main goal of FoWRA is to help users reduce the amount of food they waste, save money, and promote a more sustainable lifestyle.

## Key Features

1. **Inventory Management**: Users can track the food items they have at home and receive notifications about items approaching their expiration date.
2. **Recipe Suggestions**: The app suggests recipes based on the ingredients available in the user's inventory, helping them use up food before it goes bad.
3. **Barcode Scanning**: Users can scan food product barcodes to get information on expiration dates, allowing them to plan to use or donate food items before they expire.
4. **Tips and Tricks**: The app provides tips for reducing food waste, including proper storage techniques, meal planning, and composting.
5. **Community Connection**: Users can connect with others in their community to share tips, recipes, and ideas for reducing food waste.
6. **Food Donations**: Users can donate surplus food to nearby food banks.

## Benefits
